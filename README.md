# Tensorflow-Gemstone-Classification

## Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to explore the functionality of Tensorflow by attempting image classification. This project could also help with the creation of a gemstone identification application. Researchers, professionals, or individuals interested in the collection and identification of gemstones would be interested in our project. For example, if an individual wants to repair his or her gemstones, they could use the gemstone application to get the right gemstones. Another is in the development of a gemstone collection and managing the collection. The simple use case is coming across a gemstone and trying to discover the type of gemstone.

## Portfolio Data:
We will be using a dataset that consists of 3,200+ images of different gemstones and 87 classes. The data is publicly available and is on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/gemstones-images).

## Development:
Load, resized, and cleansed the gemstone data
Researched Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the possible uses for gemstone image classification
Utilized VGG16 Model (pre-trained CNN Model) for image classification
Utilized CNN Model (own CNN Model) for image classification
Determined our own train CNN Model to be the best applicable model, achieving classification accuracy score of 0.49 with only 18 epochs.
